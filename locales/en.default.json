There they purchased an apple farm and named it \"Liberty Orchards\" in honor of their new homeland. Soon they were producing more apples than they could sell, and had the idea to recreate \"locoum,\" a favorite old-world confection, using their surplus fruit mixed with fresh walnuts. They named their new candy Aplets®, and a few years later they added Cotlets®, made with apricots and walnuts. Since then, Liberty Orchards has created a delicious variety of fruit confections, but we still make them much like Mark and Armen did back in 1920. We still use only the finest quality ingredients, slow-cooked to sweet perfection in small batches. We still pack each tempting morsel by hand.
